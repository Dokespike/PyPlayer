PyPlayer
========
An extremely simple and light weight music player made with python.

This is project is being made by none other than myself (Matthew Shaw) in an attempt to 
make the most basic and simple, yet functional, music player for your enjoyment.




Dependences to install:
=======================
"python-imaging-tk"
"python-pygame"

If you are new to linux and are using Ubuntu or a Raspberry Pi do the following:
sudo apt-get install (one of the above)




Anything else?:
===============
All the music you open will have the dirrectorys saved to the file CSI.txt

Open the "Config.txt" file and put the dirrectory of where your music is stored,
or the lowest possible folder where your music is stored.

If you have a bunch of music and it fills the list box, to scroll down click 
inside it and move the mouse down/up to browse through the listbox.
