PyPlayer
========
An extremely simple and light weight music player made with python.

This is project is being made in an attempt to make the most basic and
simple, yet functional music player for your enjoyment.




Dependences to install:
=======================

Then you will need the following python modules:

"python-imaging-tk"
"python-pygame"

If you are new to linux and are using Ubuntu (Debian based) do the following:
sudo apt-get install (one of the above) (You need to do it to both)

While you dont _need_ this, if you want the logo for the program in the window use:
http://i.imgur.com/5TDnX78.png
and save it as "logo.png" in the same folder as PyPlayer, after that change "Have Logo Image(1/0)=0" so that the 0 at the end is a 1 




Anything else?:
===============
All the music you open will have the dirrectorys saved to the file CSI.txt

Open the "Config.txt" file and put the dirrectory of where your music is stored,
or the lowest folder where your music is stored.

If you have a bunch of music and it fills the list box, to scroll down click 
inside it and move the mouse down/up to browse through the listbox.
