PyPlayer
========
An extremely simple and light weight music player made with python.

This is project is being made in an attempt to make the most basic and simple, yet functional music player for your enjoyment, while its not the most impressive thing ever it aims to be easy to read and understand.



# 10 year update!
Hello all zero users of this software, turns out the python2.7 vs python3 thing happened. Needless to say this does not run and the dependencies I list below no longer exist on apt.
I would love to fix this but I clearly had _no_idea_ what I was doing a decade ago. Maybe i'll decipher this pizzle of a codebase at some point as it was my first real project I had ever done. 


Dependences to install:
=======================

Then you will need the following python modules:

"python-imaging-tk"
"python-pygame"

If you are new to linux and are using Ubuntu (Debian based) do the following:
sudo apt-get install (one of the above) (You need to do it to both)



Anything else?:
===============
All the music you open will have the dirrectorys saved to the file MusicDir.txt

Open the "Config.txt" file and put the dirrectory of where your music is stored, or most "shallow" from where your music is stored.

If you have a bunch of music and it fills the listbox, to scroll down click inside the listbox and move the mouse down/up or simply enable the use of arrow buttons to move up and down inside the Config.txt file
