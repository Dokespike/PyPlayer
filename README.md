PyPlayer
========
An extremely simple and light weight music player made from python and its modules.

This is project is being made by none other than myself (Matthew Shaw) in an attempt to 
make the most basic and simple, yet functional,  music player anyone could ever construct,
exclusively from open source tools.

READ THIS PART IF ANYTHING!

This is, in all honestly NOT worth downloading in its current state. Right now it has less
than subpar audio playback.

If you wanted to use this as a music client for a raspberry pi than that would make sense, or
if you want to take chunks of the source code that is here than thats fine and dandy too.

Otherwise this isnt worth your time right now.
