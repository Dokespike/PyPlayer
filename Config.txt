"Check for same song" is bugged, you need to load at least one song without it on for it to work


"Music Folder" is used to get rid of extra text. If you know all of you music is in or "deeper" then your home folder for instance, put the dirrectory to your home folder.
You can leave Music Folder empty but it will leave the full dirrectory to every song.
